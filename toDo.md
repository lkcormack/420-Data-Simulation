# To do list for improving these functions

## Larry's list

* incoporate rounding from VN into regData - all
* ditto for regDataCor
* add optional boundary checks for grpData.R
* grpData for independent 1-way type stuff - pivot to longform (tidy data!) 
* make a simple t-test function (that  calls grpData)

## Alex's list 

* make a function to merge data frames - Alex
* function for paired t-test data
* make binary data generator 

## for the future

* within S multi group
* factorial data (MASS)
* gasp - factorial within between up to 6-way interaction
