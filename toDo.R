# incoporate rounding from VN into regData - all

# ditto for regDataCor

# make a function to merge data frames - Alex

# add optional boundary checks for grpData.R =-Larry

# make a simple t-test function (that  calls grpData) - Larry

# keep grpData for independent 1-way type stuff - pivot to longform (tidy data!) - Larry

# function for paired t-test data - Alex


### for future

# within S multi group

# factorial data (MASS)


# gasp - factorial within between up to 6-way interaction
